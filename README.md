# Client-Server
Of course, here is the full list of topics that can be included in your project documentation:

## Project Documentation

#### 1. Project Description and Objective

This document contains the documentation of a command server project that works in a Client-Server structure. The purpose of this project is to enable users to perform operations by sending commands to the server via the command line.

### 2. Installation Instructions

The project will be run on a local computer. Below are the installation steps of the project:

1. Make sure the Java JDK is installed on your computer.
2. Open the command prompt and navigate to the project's home folder.
3. Compile the project by entering the following command:
   
   ```
   javac -cp .:path/to/junit-4.x.jar *.java
   ```
   
   Update `path/to/junit-4.x.jar` to the path of the JUnit library in the local directory.

### 3. User Guide

This section describes how to use the project command line:

1. To start the server:
   
   ```
   java Server
   ```

2. To start the client:

   ```
   java Client
   ```

3. You can enter the desired command in the client command line and send it to the server.

### 4. Architecture and Design

The project basically consists of two components, the server and the client. The server listens for incoming connections and processes incoming commands. The client sends the user's commands to the server and receives the output from the server.

### 5. Testing and Validation

Various test cases have been created in the project. You can use the following commands to run the tests:

```
javac -cp .:path/to/junit-4.x.jar *.java
java -cp .:path/to/junit-4.x.jar:hamcrest-core-1.3.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore CommandTest ServerTest
```

### 6. Debugging

If you encounter errors while running the project, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the commands and parameters you are using.
2. Make sure that the server and client applications are running on the correct ports.
3. Make sure you have compiled the project correctly and added the necessary libraries.

#### 7. Known Issues and Limitations

- The server accepts only one client connection at a time.
- Server-client communication is not secure and is not authenticated.
